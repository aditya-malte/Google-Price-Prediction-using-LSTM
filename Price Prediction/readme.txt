Google Price prediction using historical data 
Window-60 days
Used 3 features to predict price(Closing price, etc).

Future additions:
1) Addding financial metrics like RSI, MACD, etc. to detect trends 
   in graph.
2) Try training it in reverse too(i.e BiLSTM), to check for probable 
   performance improvements.
3) Try other time series models (autoregressive, ARIMA, etc) for this problem.
